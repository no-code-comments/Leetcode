# LEETCODE COLLECTIONS
## Declaration

All problems are cited from [Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/problems/).

All ideas of the algorithm to the problems is based on online resources.

All solutions in **Solution** part is written by myself.

## Preface

Algorithm is a hard topic, not only coming up with an efficient idea, but also implementing the idea with code.

To solve a problem, there exists three major steps.

1. **Know the problem.** It includes a lot of aspects — know the input-output transformation; know potential corner cases; know the constraints of input… and so forth. This step let you think comprehensively in the following steps.
2. **Come up with a feasible solution.** For some hard problems, it is almost impossible to get an efficient solution at the first time. Coming up with one feasible solution, even with brute-force method, can help you understand the problem better.
3. **Optimize the solution.** In general cases, $O(n \log n)$ is the upper bound of an accepted algorithm for a simple problem. It is very likely to exceed this standard using only basic coding skills instead of algorithm techniques. In this step, you need to consider data structures and specific operations to reduce the time complexity using knowledge about algorithm.

However, it is difficult to generate an efficient algorithm, because the best solutions are prone to have complex mathematics principles and complicated logics. Therefore, practicing is an essential to be experienced to generate more efficient algorithms for a new problem.

## Introduction

This is a collection of solutions to problems in Leetcode. 

There is a README file in every directory, containing all the information about that problem.

- Problem — The same description copied from Leetcode website.
- Procedure — The explanation of the problem and the solution.
    - Basic algorithm — The general algorithm for the problem
    - Extra discussion — Detailed implementation and further extension
- Solution — The successful submitted code based on the previous algorithm

## Suggestions

Firstly, I recommend you to download the files and read it with your own Markdown editor such as [Typora](https://typora.io/). Some of the parts like complex mathematics expressions may not be rendered correctly in Github. 

For understanding the solution to the problem, directly scanning the **Solution** part is useless. The **Procedure** part explain the algorithm in detail, but I recommend you to read both **Basic algorithm** and **Extra discussion**. The former part contains a basic ideology for the algorithm, and the latter part is about some detailed implementation (in C++) and some discussion over corner cases. They are all significantly pivotal for understanding an algorithm.
